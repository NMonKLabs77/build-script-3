## Explanation

The script starts by displaying a menu of options. The user can then select an option by entering the corresponding number. The script then executes the selected option.

The following is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The first line of the script specifies the shell that will be used to execute the script.
2. A menu of options based on numbers is dispalyed to user
3. User is prompted to enter option. For example, 1 for Currently logged user
4. A case statement is initialized with a variable ```$option```
5. Option 1: ```whoami``` is used to show the current logged in user
6. Option 2: ``` echo $SHELL ``` is used to show our current shell directory
7. Option 3: ``` echo $HOME ``` is used to show path to our home directory
8. Option 4: ```uname -a``` shows the user all information about the operating system
9. Option 5: ```pwd`` shows the directory we are currently in
10. Option 6: ```who | wc -l ``` outputs the number of users which are logged in
11. Option 7: ```cat /etc/shells``` shows to the user the number of shells he/she has available
12. Option 8: ```df -h``` shows all hardware information
13. Option 9: ``` lscpu``` shows the user all CPU information
14. Option 10: ```free -h ``` shows the user memory information
15. Option 11: ``` df -i``` shows the user all information about files
16. Option 12: ``` ps aux``` shows the user all processes that are currently running in system
17. Option 0 : ```Exit``` allows user to exit
18. ```*``` This option handles any events of putting invalid options
19. ```esac``` terminates the case statement
20. The user is then prompted to press enter if he would like to continue ```read -p "Press Enter to continue..."```
